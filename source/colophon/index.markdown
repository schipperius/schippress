Of course, this is not how things began. In late July 2008, I had no IT skills what-so-ever, I had written a book a few years earlier and wanted to put it up on the Web. Easy, or so I thought. 

A quick search led me to Elizabeth Castroâ€™s, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0321430840/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=0321430840&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=booofjac-20">HTML, XHTML, and CSS, Sixth Edition: Visual QuickStart Guide</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.ca/e/ir?t=booofjac-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=15&amp;a=0321430840" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.

In August 2010, I found [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and discovered [web development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development) thanks to Michael Hartl and his [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/). 

From there, I built and rebuilt a local environment using a number of tools including OS X as the operating system, [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/) as a command line interface (CLI) used to interact directly with the computer. [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) as a package management system that easily installs an asortment of additional tools. [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) as a text editor and of course [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) to see the results.
