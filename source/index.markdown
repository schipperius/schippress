From my earliest recolections I have been on a mission to explore, investigate and learn.

This innate curiosity drives my motivation to seek out that which I do not yet know or understand. It was recently suggested that I share my observations with a wider audience.

Does the [Web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) need another blog like this one? I donâ€™t think so, but if some good can come of it, then sobeit. 


Enjoy <a class="read-on" href="/articles">the articles</a>.
