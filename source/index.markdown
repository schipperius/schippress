From my earliest recolections I have been on a mission to explore, investigate and learn. 

This innate curiosity drives my motivation to seek out that which I do not yet know or understand. It was recently suggested that I share my observations with a wider audience.

Does the [Web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) need another blog like this one? I donâ€™t think so, but if I can provide a perspective that teaches and maybe entertains, then perhaps this contribution will not be in vain.

Enjoy,
